## 🎯 **STEP-BY-STEP DEPLOYMENT (15 minutes)**

### **Phase 1: Setup Railway Backend (5 minutes)**

#### 1. Create Railway Account
- Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
- Click "Login" → "Login with GitHub"
- This creates your free Railway account

#### 2. Create New Project
- Click "New Project"
- Choose "Deploy from GitHub repo"
- Connect your GitHub account if needed
- **Important**: You'll need to upload your backend to GitHub first

#### 3. Prepare Backend for GitHub
Create a separate repository for your backend:
- Repository name: `styler-backend`
- Upload ONLY the contents of your `styler-backend` folder
- Include: All Java files, pom.xml, railway.json, Procfile

#### 4. Deploy Backend on Railway
- Select your `styler-backend` repository
- Railway auto-detects it's a Java/Maven project
- Click "Deploy"
- Wait 2-3 minutes for build completion

#### 5. Add Database to Railway
- In your Railway project dashboard
- Click "New" → "Database" → "Add PostgreSQL"
- Railway automatically provides connection details
- Database is ready instantly!

#### 6. Get Your Backend URL
- Once deployed, Railway provides a URL like:
- `https://styler-backend-production-abc123.up.railway.app`
- Copy this URL - you'll need it for frontend

---

### **Phase 2: Update Frontend Configuration (2 minutes)**

Update your `api-config.js` with the Railway URL:

```javascript
// Replace the return line with your actual Railway URL
return window.BACKEND_URL || 'https://your-railway-url-here.up.railway.app';
```

---

### **Phase 3: Deploy Frontend on Vercel (5 minutes)**

#### 1. Prepare Frontend Repository  
- Repository name: `styler-frontend` 
- Upload ALL files EXCEPT `styler-backend` folder
- Include updated `api-config.js`

#### 2. Deploy on Vercel
- Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
- Login with GitHub
- "New Project" → Import your `styler-frontend` repository
- Click "Deploy"
- Get your live URL: `https://styler-frontend.vercel.app`

---

### **Phase 4: Connect Frontend to Backend (3 minutes)**

#### 1. Update CORS in Railway
Railway should automatically allow your Vercel domain, but if needed:
- In Railway project → Variables
- Set `CORS_ORIGINS=https://your-vercel-url.vercel.app`

#### 2. Test Complete System
Visit your Vercel URL and test:
- ✅ User registration → Stored in Railway PostgreSQL
- ✅ Login from different devices → Shared accounts
- ✅ Place orders → Stored in cloud database  
- ✅ Order history → Retrieved from database
